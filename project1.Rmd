In Summer 2022, I worked in the Criminal Division of the Department of Justice to analyze crime trends. Our office was tasked with visualizing the daily aggravated assault and homicide trends in over 20 major US cities. For the past few years, the office used STATA to map these trends, which was a time consuming process. I built a R script that scraped the data from the public police department data portals, turning a process that took hours to complete in only seconds.

The black line represents the daily record of aggravated assault trends, while the red line is the rolling 5 year average. The 5 year average is intended to explain whether the daily pattern is a positive or negative deviation from the 5 year average. The two trends are closely correlated, telling us that current trends do not drastically deviate from previous ones.
