My name is Charlie Bruce. I will be graduating with my Master's in Public Policy in May 2023 from the [Frank Batten School of Leadership and Public Policy](https://batten.virginia.edu/) at UVA.

I began my journey with statistical models while working as a political organizer, where I built voter universes for Democratic campaigns. To determine which voters to contact, we used a propensity scoring system that ranked voters based on their likelihood to vote Democratic and their voting frequency.

To make a lasting impact and gain leadership skills, I applied to graduate school in public policy, where I learned the adaptive leadership method Ã  la Ron Heifetz. This past summer, I had the opportunity to intern at the Department of Justice, where I worked on building data visualizations in R for various projects.

For life's next chapter, I am applying to positions that bring together policy analysis and data visualization. You can reach me via email at [ceb8dv@virginia.edu](mailto:ceb8dv@virginia.edu).
